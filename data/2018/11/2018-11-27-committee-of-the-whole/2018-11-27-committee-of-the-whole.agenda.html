    <br/>
    −    a three-year capital budget that recapitalizes assets, funds growth related issues and is balanced to the fiscal framework;
    <br/>
    −    a responsible debt position;
    <br/>
    −    appropriate reserve balances that allow for risk mitigation, future obligations, and opportunities; and,
    <br/>
    −    alignment of the current average tax bill for residential homes and commercial properties under two scenarios:
    <br/>
    a)    2.1% increase for 2019-20;
