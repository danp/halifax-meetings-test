    10.1 STAFF
  </p>
  <p>
    10.1.1 Case 21850: Application by Michael Napier Architecture Inc. requesting to amend the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law to remove a portion of the property at 5426 Portland Place, Halifax from Schedule HA-1 to allow for additional residential development.
  </p>
  <p>
    A proposal for a 6-storey residential building including underground parking was submitted for consideration under the existing C-2 (General Business) Zone rules. In the permit review, staff identified that Schedule HA-1 of the Halifax MPS was applicable to a portion of the subject site. Schedule HA-1 aims to preserve the heritage character of Brunswick Street. This schedule allows a building of the same height, mass, and setbacks to be built on the site; but does not allow for more than four residential units within the first 50 feet from Portland Place where the Schedule applies to the lot.
  </p>
  <p>
    The applicant has modified their design to include only commercial uses within the Schedule HA-1 portion of the lot, and has a building permit to construct a mixed-use building. The applicant has requested to remove Schedule HA-1 from the property to allow the entire building to be residential uses.
    <br/>
    In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community with regard to the following:
    <br/>
    • The impact to surrounding heritage resources
    <br/>
    • The impact to both use and form of removing Schedule HA-1 from the portion of the property to which it applies
  </p>
  <p>
    The following is before the Committee:
    <br/>
    •    Applicant Application Submission Letter
    <br/>
    •    Building Plans for 5426 Portland Place - Currently Under Construction

    10.1.2 Case 22019 - Residential Conversions in the Peninsula Centre and South End Detailed Plan Areas of the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law
  </p>
  <p>
    Halifax and West Community Council requested that staff prepare a recommendation report on amending the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law to clarify the application of Sections 34E and 34U, which permit internal conversions of existing dwellings to two and three-unit dwellings in the R-1 (Single Family) and R-1A (Single Family A) Zones.
  </p>
  <p>
    The proposed clarification would ensure that 34E and 34U can permit conversions within the R-1 and R-1A zones only, and that residential conversions within the R-2 (General Residential) Zone are regulated by Section 43E of the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law.
  </p>
  <p>
    The requested change would only affect properties in the South End and Peninsula Centre Detailed Plan Areas.  In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following is before the Committee:

    •    Peninsula Centre Detailed Plan Area Map
    <br/>
    •    South End Detailed Plan Area Map
    <br/>
    •    Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law Zoning Map
