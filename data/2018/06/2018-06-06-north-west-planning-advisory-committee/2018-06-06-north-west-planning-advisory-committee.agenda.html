    9.1.1
    <strong>
      Case 21212:
    </strong>
    Application by WM Fares Architects, on behalf of Oceanstone Seaside Resort, to amend the Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-law for Planning Districts 1 and 3 for 8646 and 8650 Peggys Cove Road, Indian Harbour in order to recognize the existing tourist industry use and permit its future expansion
    <br/>
    <br/>
    During a recent compliance case, HRM staff determined that the subject property does not comply with the requirements of the MU-1 (Mixed Use 1) Zone. As such, the applicant wishes to rezone the property to the C-3 (Tourist Industry) Zone, which is more reflective of its current use and would provide greater flexibility regarding the resort’s future development. The major aspects of the proposal are:
    <br/>
    • Create a definition for a “Resort” use;
    <br/>
    • Rezone the subject property from the MU-1 Zone to the C-3 Zone; and
    <br/>
    • Create new MPS policy to consider desired rezoning request.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In preparing the recommendation to North West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community. The following is before the Committee:
    <br/>
    • Potential of adversely affecting nearby residential and community facility development;
    <br/>
    • Impact of the proposal’s operation characteristics on the surrounding community;
    <br/>
    • Characteristics that make the site suitable for the desired use;
    <br/>
    • Effect of the proposal on traffic volumes and the local road network; and
    <br/>
    • Means by which solid and liquid waste will be treated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The following is before the Committee:
    <br/>
    • Applicant’s Letter
    <br/>
    • Site Plan

    9.1.2
    <strong>
      Case 21564:
    </strong>
    Application has been submitted by Nicolette Nicholas to rezone 65 Halfway Lake Drive from the R-1 (Single Unit Dwelling) Zone to the R-1A (Auxiliary Dwelling) Zone in order to permit an auxiliary dwelling unit within the dwelling
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The applicant recently purchased 65 Halfway Lake Drive, which contains a single unit dwelling and auxiliary dwelling unit. A recent compliance case determined that the auxiliary dwelling unit was not approved and the property does not conform to the R-1 (Single Unit Dwelling) Zone. As such, the applicant has applied to rezone the property to the R-1A (Auxiliary Dwelling) Zone in order to bring the auxiliary unit into conformance. The major aspects of the proposal are:
    <br/>
    • Rezone subject property from the R-1 Zone to the R-1A Zone to permit the existing auxiliary dwelling unit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In preparing the recommendation to North West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community. The following is before the Committee:
    <br/>
    • Maximum gross floor area shall not exceed 40% of the dwelling’s overall gross floor area;
    <br/>
    • No more than one main entrance along the front wall of the dwelling;
    <br/>
    • Auxiliary dwelling unit’s power meter shall not be located on front façade; and
    <br/>
    • One off-street parking space shall be provided for any single unit dwelling containing an auxiliary dwelling unit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The following is before the Committee:
    <br/>
    • Designation Map
    <br/>
    • Zoning Map
    <br/>
    • R-1 Zone
    <br/>
    • R-1A Zone
    <br/>
    • Minutes from May 7, 2018 PIM
