    <br/>
    10.1.1 Case 21606 - Application by Shelley Dickey Land Use Planning requesting an amendment to the Height Precinct Map of the Halifax Peninsula Land Use Bylaw for 5450 Cornwallis Street, Halifax (Delmore Buddy Daye Learning Institute) to increase the maximum building height from 40 feet to 68 feet to allow for two additional floors on the existing building.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy designates the site for future high-density residential (HDR) development. The zoning of the site is C-2 (General Business) zone, which reflects the existing use of the property, and a height precinct (limitation) of 40 feet applies to the site.  MPS policies provide for medium-rise development, and allow for proposals to amend the Land Use By-law, provided that such proposal is compatible with the surrounding neighbourhood.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feedback is sought from Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committee relative to the proposed application. In preparing your recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, kindly advise whether the proposal complies with the policies of the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy in consideration of compatibility: Is the proposed increase in building height (two additional floors) compatible with the surrounding neighbourhood and consistent with the intent of the MPS? Please advise of any other applicable land use issues/ impacts.
