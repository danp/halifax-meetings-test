      Case 18276
    </a>
    : Application by KWR Approvals Incorporated to consider residential development, by development agreement, at 74 Union Street, Bedford.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In 1991, three major undeveloped portions of Bedford were identified for future residential growth: Paper Mill Lake, Crestview and Union Street. These three areas were designated and zoned RCDD (Residential Comprehensive Development District) under the Municipal Planning Strategy (MPS) and Land Use By-law (LUB) for the Bedford Plan Area. The RCDD designation allows for the consideration of various forms of residential, institutional and limited neighbourhood commercial development by development agreement. The applicant is proposing 14 townhouse residential units on the subject property with access provided from Union Street. The applicant has provided background information related to environmental features of the site, traffic and transportation, municipal services, and the existing surrounding community uses.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    •    Traffic
    <br/>
