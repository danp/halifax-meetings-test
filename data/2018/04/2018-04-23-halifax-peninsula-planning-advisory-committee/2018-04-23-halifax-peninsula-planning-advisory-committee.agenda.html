    10.1 STAFF
    <br/>
    10.1.1 Case 21599: Application by Shelley Dickey Land Use Planning to amend the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-Law for the purpose of rezoning 7 properties to the C-3 (Industrial) Zone. The properties have civic addresses on Stairs and Livingstone Streets, bounded by Massachusetts Avenue and Kempt Road, Halifax. Rezoning is a preliminary step towards construction of a proposed motor vehicle dealership and service facility covering all 7 subject lots. The block on which the 7 properties are located has 3 other lots, not part of this application, but already zoned C-3.
    <br/>
    The properties currently support a brewery and car rental business, with the majority of the land being used for surface parking. Four of the subject properties are zoned R-2 (General Residential) but have not been used for residential purposes for decades and there are no housing structures remaining. The remaining 3 properties are C-2 (General Business) or mixed C-2/C-3 (Industrial). Both the Regional Plan and Halifax MPS designate the entire subject site as IND (Industrial), and City-Wide Policies 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5 located in Section II of the Halifax MPS provide direction relative to compatibility of industrial uses to their surrounding uses.
    <br/>
    The Kempt Road corridor on which these lands are located is a major automotive business service area within HRM. In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess the quality of: compatibility with the existing neighbourhood and lot fabric, the appropriateness of the change in land use, and the removal of four R-2 properties from the residential land supply in favour of industrial uses.
    <br/>
    The following is before the Committee:
    <br/>
    •    Application Letter including proposed site plan and zoning map

  </p>
  <p>
    To establish Schmidtville as a Heritage Conservation District, a Heritage Conservation District Plan (the Heritage District Plan) and Heritage Conservation District By-law (the Heritage District By-law) must be adopted. The Heritage District Plan and the Heritage District By-law require amendments to the local municipal planning strategy and land use by-law to provide consistency between these documents.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of the Schmidtville Heritage Conservation District plan is to encourage the preservation, rehabilitation, and restoration of Schmidtville’s historic buildings and public spaces. The Heritage Conservation District Plan recognizes both the thriving residential community and the historic significance of the built environment in Schmidtville.
  </p>
  <p>
    Schmidtville is the first private subdivision in Halifax. The neighbourhood is valued as a largely intact area of traditional architectural character and for its association with the early settlement of Nova Scotia as one of Halifax’s first suburbs outside the fortified fences. Schmidtville is also valued for its association with the economic and social history of Halifax, revealed through its existing character. Schmidtville buildings have strong associations with the Georgian and Victorian eras and most buildings exemplify these architectural
  </p>
  <p>
    It is recommended that the Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committee recommend that the Halifax and West Community Council recommend that Regional Council:
    <br/>
    1.    Give First Reading to consider the amendments to the Municipal Planning Strategy for Halifax and  the Land Use By-law for Halifax Peninsula, as contained in Attachments C and D, and schedule a public hearing; and
    <br/>
    2.    Adopt the amendments to the Municipal Planning Strategy for Halifax and the Land Use By-law for Halifax Peninsula as set out in Attachments C and D.
