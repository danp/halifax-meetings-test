      Case 21618
    </a>
    : Application by WSP Canada Inc. for substantive amendments to an existing Development Agreement (Case 18254) that enables an eight-storey mixed-use development located at 5511 Bloomfield Street, Halifax.
  </p>
  <p>
    On September 23, 2013, Halifax and West Community Council (HWCC) approved a development agreement (DA) that enables an eight-storey mixed-use development at the site. A permit was issued for the construction of a 70-unit mixed use development in March 2017; the building is currently under construction. On January 23, 2018, HWCC refused an application for substantive amendments to the DA. The applicant submitted a new application with changes to the design for Council’s consideration. The requested amendments include to:
    <br/>
    •    Infill the previously approved surface parking with a four-storey addition along Almon Street with commercial uses on the ground level;
    <br/>
    •    Increase the total number of permitted residential units;
    <br/>
    •    Increase the number of units having 2 or more bedrooms;
    <br/>
    •    Add indoor amenity space at the penthouse level and a landscaped podium on the 5th floor of the proposed four-storey addition;
    <br/>
    •    Extend the street wall (wall of the building closest to the street) along Bloomfield Street; and
    <br/>
    •    Re-locate all onsite parking underground.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community. Quality of indoor and outdoor amenity space, the quality of design detail at street level including landscaping and building entrances and the quality of mitigation of impacts on adjacent properties through effective urban design and landscape treatment.
  </p>

    The following is before the Committee:
    <br/>
    •    Application letter
    <br/>
