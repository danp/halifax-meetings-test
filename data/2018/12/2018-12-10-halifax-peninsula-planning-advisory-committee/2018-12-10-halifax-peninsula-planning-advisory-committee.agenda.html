    10.1 STAFF
  </p>
  <p>
    10,1.1  Case 22020 - Halifax and West Community Council (HWCC) requested that staff prepare a recommendation report outlining potential amendments to the Halifax Peninsula LUB RC-1 Zone that will define grocery and pharmacy use, and limit hours of operation in the RC-1 Zone.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Halifax Peninsula LUB does not define grocery or drug stores and concern was raised that the lack of definition led to overly permissive use with negative effects on neighbourhoods from grocery stores operating late night and early morning hours selling food. Other Plan Areas and their By-laws define grocery store or similar. There are 25 properties currently zoned RC-1 in the Halifax Peninsula.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following is before the Committee:

    10.1.2    Case 20520-  Application by Dexel Developments Limited to amend the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and Peninsula Land Use By-law to enable a development agreement for an 8-storey (plus penthouse) mixed-use development at 6324 &amp; 6330 Quinpool Road.
  </p>
  <p>
    Part of the proposed building would face Pepperell Street.The subject property is 6324 and 6330 Quinpool Road (PID 00165878). This lot has frontage on Quinpool Road and Pepperell Street. There is one building on site, which houses a McDonald’s Restaurant (with drive through) and Fitness FX, a gym.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to consider how the proposal generally aligns with the June 2017 Centre Plan documents relative to Urban Structure, Height and Floor Area Ratio, and how the proposal addresses the planning principles of transition, pedestrian-orientation, human scale, building design and context sensitive as noted in Table 2 of the HRM staff report dated July 26, 2017.   In addition to the above, the Committee is also asked to consider how the proposal meets the requirements of Regional Plan Policy CH-16.
