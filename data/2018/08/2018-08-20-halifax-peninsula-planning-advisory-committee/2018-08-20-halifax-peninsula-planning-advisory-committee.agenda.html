    10.1.1 Case 20218: Spring Garden Road, Robie Street and Carlton Street, Halifax
    <br/>
    Dexel Developments has requested amendments to the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law to permit a mixed-use development along Spring Garden Road, Robie Street and Carlton Street.  As proposed, the development includes: a 30 storey and 16 storey tower; approximately 250 residential units; approximately 60,000 square feet of office space; approximately 21,000 square feet of ground level commercial space; and underground parking for approximately 361 vehicles.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The subject site includes a total of 13 properties (PID #00135384; #5950, #5954A/#5954, #5958A/#5958B, #5960, #5962, #5964, #5966/5966A, #5970, #5972, #5974, #5980, #5982, #5984, #5986, #5990, #5992 and #5994 Spring Garden Road; #1403 Robie Street; and #1478, #1480/#1484 and #1494 Carlton Street).  As proposed, structures located on the subject properties, with the exception of 4 registered heritage properties (1478, 1480, 1484 and 1494 Carlton Street) will be demolished to accommodate the proposed mixed-use development.  The applicant is proposing to alter the 4 heritage properties through lot subdivision and a restoration of the existing structures.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to consider how the proposal generally aligns with the June 2017 Centre Plan documents relative to Urban Structure, Height and Floor Area Ratio, and how the proposal addresses the planning principles of transition, pedestrian-orientation, human scale, building design and context sensitive as noted in Table 2 of the HRM staff report dated July 26, 2017.

    10.1.2 Case 20761: Case 20761: Robie Street, College Street and Carlton Street, Halifax
    <br/>
    Kassner Goodspeed Architects, on behalf of 3088962 Nova Scotia Limited, has requested amendments to the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law to permit a mixed-use development along Robie Street, College Street and Carlton Street.  As proposed, the development includes: a 26 storey and 20 storey tower; approximately 400 residential units; up to 32,000 square feet of ground level commercial space; and underground parking for approximately 384 vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
    The subject site includes a total of 10 properties (PID #00473009; PID #00472993; 1377 and 1389 Robie Street; 5949, 5963, 5969, 5977 and 5989/5991/5993 College Street; and 1452 and 1456 Carlton Street.)
    <br/>
    As proposed, existing structures located at 1389 Robie Street; 5991/5993/5989; 5977; 5963; and 5949 College Street, will be demolished to accommodate the proposed mixed-use development.  The applicant has also proposed substantial alterations on three registered municipal heritage properties located at 5969 College Street, 1452 Carlton Street, and 1456 Carlton Street.  The objective of the alteration proposal is to integrate these heritage properties into the larger development project on the same block.  The alteration proposal is to move a registered municipal heritage building from its current location at 5969 College Street to a nearby location on College Street in the rear yards of two municipal heritage properties located in the registered heritage streetscape along Carlton Street.  In addition to the relocation of the building at 5969 College Street, the applicant has also proposed the relocation of the building located at 1377 Robie Street to College Street.  This building is not registered as a municipal heritage property, as such its proposed relocation is not subject to a substantial alteration application.
