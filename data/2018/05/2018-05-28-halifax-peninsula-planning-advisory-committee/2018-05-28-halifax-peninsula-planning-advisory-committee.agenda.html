    10.1.2 Case 20159: Victoria Road and South Park Street, Halifax
    <br/>
    Kassner Goodspeed Architects, on behalf of Eldorado Properties Limited, has applied to amend the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law to permit an addition to an existing 8-storey residential multiple unit building and to permit ground floor commercial uses at the northwest corner of Victoria Road and South Park Street intersection, Halifax.  As proposed, the existing multiple unit dwelling, located at 5713 Victoria Road, will receive a one storey addition for a total of 9 storeys.  Further, 2 existing residential detached dwellings, located at 1102 and 1106 South Park Street, will be removed and replaced with a 9 storey addition.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to consider how the proposal generally aligns with the June 2017 Centre Plan documents relative to Urban Structure, Height and Floor Area Ratio, and how the proposal addresses the planning principles of transition, pedestrian-orientation, human scale, building design and context sensitive as noted in Table 2 of the HRM staff report dated July 26, 2017.
