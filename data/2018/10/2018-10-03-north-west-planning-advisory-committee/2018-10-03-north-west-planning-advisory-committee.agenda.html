    <strong>
      Case 21873
    </strong>
    : Application by Halifax Regional Municipality to consider a rezoning at 435 Hammonds Plains Road, Bedford from the US (Urban Settlement) Zone and RR (Residential Reserve) Zone to the SI (Institutional) Zone Halifax Regional Municipality, for the lands of Maritime Conference of the Seventh Day Adventist Church Inc., wishes to rezone 435 Hammonds Plains Road, Bedford from the US (Urban Settlement) Zone and RR (Residential Reserve) Zone to the SI (Institutional) Zone. This will allow for further development of Sandy Lake Academy under the SI Zone regulations of the Bedford Land Use By-law.

  <p>
    The major aspects of the proposal are:
    <br/>
    • Permits for an educational institution (Sandy Lake Academy) were approved in 1973;
    <br/>
    • Subject site was rezoned to SI (Institutional) in 2003 (Case 00511);
    <br/>
    • Regional Plan was adopted in 2006 and inadvertently rezoned a large area of land around Sandy Lake (including the entire subject site) back to US (Urban Settlement) and RR (Residential Reserve);
    <br/>
    • Sandy Lake Academy has since operated as a non-conforming use;
    <br/>
    • This application wishes to reinstate the SI Zone that was inadvertently removed to permit future as-of-right development for the existing institutional use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Relevant MPS Policy:
    <br/>
    <em>
      Policy S-3   It shall be the intention of Town Council to permit new utility and institutional uses on any land use designation, except WFCDD, CCDD, and RCDD designation, through the zoning amendment process subject to the rezoning criteria in Policy Z-3. No lands will be prezoned for such uses.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to Northwest Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community reinstating the SI zone may have.

    9.1.2
    <strong>
      Case 21812
    </strong>
    :  Application by WSP Canada Inc., on behalf of PRO Real Estate Investment Trust (PRO REIT), to amend the Municipal Planning Strategy to enable non-substantive amendments to the existing development agreement for St. Margaret’s Square (PIDs 41410010 and 40897118), Upper Tantallon St. Margaret’s Square is regulated by the Planning Districts 1 &amp; 3 (St. Margaret’s Bay) Municipal Planning Strategy (MPS). In 2012, the subject site was located in the Mixed Use B Designation and, as such, MPS Policy MU-16(A) enabled Council to consider new commercial developments or expansions resulting in a gross floor area in excess of 697 square metres (7,500 square feet) by development agreement. It is this policy under which the original development agreement was approved by Western Regional Community Council on July 12, 2012. The existing development agreement permits a five-building commercial development; three buildings have been constructed, while Phases C and D remain undeveloped.

  <p>
    The applicant has applied to undertake non-substantive amendments to the existing development agreement for St. Margaret’s Square. The proposed amendments cannot be considered under the existing revised MPS policies (2018) and, therefore, in order to proceed, amendments to the Planning Districts 1 &amp; 3 (St. Margaret’s Bay) Municipal Planning Strategy (MPS) are required.
  </p>
  <p>
    The non-substantive amendments pursuant to Section 6.1 of the existing development agreement proposes to modify the Phase C building as follows:
    <br/>
    • Replace the second storey with a mezzanine, and reduce the building height from 2 to 1.5 storeys;
    <br/>
    • Increase the building footprint from 17,000 sq.ft to 18,700 sq.ft;
    <br/>
    • Reduce the gross floor area from 34,000 sq.ft to 19,825 sq.ft; and
    <br/>
    • Alter the building’s exterior architectural appearance.
    <br/>
    In preparing recommendation to North West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community with regard to the following:
    <br/>
    - Intent of policy MU 16 (A) from Planning Districts 1 &amp; 3 MPS (2012 &amp; 2018) that enabled the DA and the non-substantive amendments.
    <br/>
    - Intent of policy IM-9 and the list of the criteria to be considered within the development agreement.
    <br/>
    - Intent and compatibility of new (2018) policies CV-6 and CV-7 from Planning Districts 1&amp;3 MPS relative to the proposed plan amendments
    <br/>
    The following is before the Committee:
    <br/>
    - Applicant Submission
    <br/>
    - Summary of Pubic feedback
