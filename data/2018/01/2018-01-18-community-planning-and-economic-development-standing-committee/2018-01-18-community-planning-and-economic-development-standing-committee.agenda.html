    <br/>
    That the Community Planning and Economic Development Standing Committee recommend that Halifax Regional Council request a staff report to assess options for requesting the transfer of the responsibility to operate and deliver housing programs and services within the boundaries of Halifax on behalf of the Province, including but not limited to the following considerations:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. Transferring of the responsibilities of Housing Nova Scotia in the Halifax region, including Metro Regional Housing Authority (MRHA) to the municipality;
    <br/>
    2. Fund this transfer through property tax, by redirecting property tax points from the mandatory education funding collected by the municipality for the province, to ensure the core housing program operations would be funded by property tax revenue, rather than provincial grants;
    <br/>
    3. Require provincial participation and cost sharing in Federal housing and regionally significant housing programs with equitable per-capita distribution of funds based on population;
    <br/>
    4. Require the housing allowance paid to clients living in MRHA is the same as the program provides to other private and not for profit land lords.
    <br/>
    5. Make recommendations regarding management structure as either an arms length agency, a department of the municipality, or combination of options.
