  <p>
    11.1.1 Case 21076: Application by Shelley Dickey Land Use Planning requesting a rezoning of a non-compliant 6-unit dwelling from R-2 (General Residential) to the R-2A (General Residential Conversion) designation located at 3834 Robie Street, Halifax.
  </p>
  <p>
    The requested zone, R-2A, is an R-2 variant allowing for small apartment buildings from 5-14 units, above the 4-unit maximum for the R-2 Zone.  The R-2A zone permits conversion of existing building (meeting specified dates) as a mechanism to preserve older housing stock while still allowing for limited intensification.  The R-2A zone prescribes limits to parking, building volume, and floor area. This would be the first R-2A rezoning in this neighbourhood.
