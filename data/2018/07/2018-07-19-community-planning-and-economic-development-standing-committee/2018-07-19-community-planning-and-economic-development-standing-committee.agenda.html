    <strong>
      Motion:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    That the Community Planning &amp; Economic Development Standing Committee
    <br/>
    recommend that Regional Council:
    <br/>
    1. Authorize the direction contained in the Halifax Green Network Plan, as contained in Attachment A of the June 12, 2018 staff report, as a framework for amending the existing Regional Plan and Secondary Planning Strategies, and developing new planning documents as may be necessary to implement the Halifax Green Network Plan direction;
    <br/>
    2. Direct staff to carry out the actions contained in the Halifax Green Network Plan as part of the multi-year budgeting and business planning process.
    <br/>
    3. Request that the Province amend the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter, as set out in Actions
    <br/>
    18 and 61 of the Halifax Green Network Plan, to:
    <br/>
    (a) enable the Municipality to acquire sensitive environmental lands (e.g. riparian areas, wetlands, steep slopes, etc.) as an environmental reserve through the land development and subdivision process, in addition to existing parkland dedication provisions; and
    <br/>
    (b) enable a greater range of legislative abilities, such as the ability to enact parkland dedication requirements based on density to address development that does not include the subdivision of land.
    <br/>
    4. Initiate the process to consider amendments to the Regional Municipal Planning Strategy (RMPS) to support the Halifax Green Network Plan (HGNP) by referencing the HGNP within the conservation design development agreement policy criteria concerning the connectivity of open
    <br/>
    space; and
    <br/>
    5. Adopt, by policy, the Public Participation Program outlined in the Community Engagement section of the staff report dated June 12, 2018.
