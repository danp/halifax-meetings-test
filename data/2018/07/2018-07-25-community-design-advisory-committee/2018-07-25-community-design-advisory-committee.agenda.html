  </p>
  <p>
    Motion:
    <br/>
    THAT the committee supports the direction of the Centre Plan draft while noting the following areas of concern:
    <br/>
    •    Development industry concerns regarding modeling should be answered where possible with modelling released for public review,
    <br/>
    •    The committee shares the concerns of the Keesmaat report and other respondents about needing to strengthen protection and form of neighbourhood character and heritage protection,
    <br/>
    •    Additionally, the committee shares concerns regarding integration with parks planning, other municipal frameworks and priority plans, especially the Integrated Mobility Plan, Economic Plan, accessibility framework,
    <br/>
    •    Centre Plan should outline a need to work to coordinate with the province on siting and delivery of health and education,
    <br/>
    •    Connection between the Centre Plan and the Regional Plans long term planning and growth vision is especially important and should be strengthened,
    <br/>
    •    Stronger heritage supports, resources, and incentives already under consideration by Council should be in place and funded when the Centre Plan is adopted,
    <br/>
    •    The committee values a strong affordable housing plan and feels an affordable housing reserve fund could be a key component,
    <br/>
    •    The Centre Plan should indicate a need for public sector investment in Centres and Corridors where required to meet the goal of complete communities.
