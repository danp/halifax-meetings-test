    <strong>
      Case 20634
    </strong>
    : WM Fares on behalf of Old Fashioned Woodworkers Developments Ltd. is applying to rezone lands at 130 and 148 Mann St from Heavy Industrial (IHI) Zone to C&amp;D Materials Transfer (CD-1) Zone – Jennifer Chapman, Planner III
  </p>
  <p>
    This application was previously heard by the North West Planning Advisory Committee on Dec 6, 2017, with a request to rezone the land to Construction and Demolition Processing Facilities (CD-2) Zone. At that time NWPAC recommended refusing the request based on concerns about protection of the watercourses, lot size and the lack of impermeable liner. The applicant is now requesting a less intense use with the CD-1 Zone in response to these concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to North West Community Council, staff are requesting that the Committee advise whether the revised proposal complies with the policies of the Bedford Municipal Planning Strategy in consideration of the following:
    <br/>
    • Change in use
    <br/>
    • Buffering and screening
    <br/>
    • Site design
    <br/>
    • Potential environmental impacts, if any
  </p>
  <p>
    The following is before the Committee:
    <br/>
    • Environmental Management Plan
    <br/>
    • PIM Presentation

    <br/>
    • 32 residential parking spaces underground; 8 commercial spaces at ground level;

    • Cantilevered balconies proposed on all elevations of the building except elevation facing existing residential on Malik Court.
  </p>
  <p>
    This application may be considered under the Sackville Municipal Planning Strategy Policy CC-6, notwithstanding Policy CC-2, within the Community Commercial Designation, Council may consider the expansion of existing multiple unit dwellings and the development of new multiple unit dwellings according to the development agreement provisions of the Planning Act. Policy CC-6 is subject to Implementation Policy IM-13 of the Sackville MPS that is applicable to all development agreement requests.

    • Proposed building perceived as overwhelming scale for site in terms of abutting residential at Malik Court;
    <br/>
    • Shadowing of abutting residential backyards due proposed building;
    <br/>
    • Loss of privacy due separation distance and height of proposed building for abutting residents on Malik Court;
    <br/>
    • Compounding of existing community parking issues at Malik Court; and
    <br/>
    • Impacts on adjacent properties and quality of mitigation of impacts through effective urban design and landscape treatment.
