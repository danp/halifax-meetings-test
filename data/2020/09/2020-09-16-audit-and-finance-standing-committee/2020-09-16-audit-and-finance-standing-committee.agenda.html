Funds will come from the General Contingency Reserve Q421;
    <br/>
    2.    Provide in-kind support by allowing registered Canadian charitable organizations currently collecting donations for Beirut, such as the Canadian Red Cross, to set up donation collection sites at HRM owned and operated facilities and use HRM social media channels to promote donation collection sites; and,

    3.    Direct the CAO to establish a fair and transparent program to assess and evaluate future financial requests that support national and/or international disaster relief efforts. This program would outline a maximum funding limit, eligibility criteria and a detailed assessment of the proposal submitted, evaluation of the proposal based on linkage to municipal objectives, mandate and priorities, and an exploration of potential funding options.
