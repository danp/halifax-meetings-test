    <strong>
      5.1.1 Case 20110:
    </strong>
    Application by WSP, on behalf of Marque Investments, to enable the development of an open space subdivision design on four properties, identified as PID No. 41043597, 40010514, 41398694 and 41401159, located along Windgate Drive, between Rivendale Drive and Terry Road, in Beaver Bank, NS.
  </p>
  <p>
    An application for an Open Space Design Development for the subject lands was originally submitted in January 2014 (Case 19059), prior to the adoption of the 2014 Regional Plan Review (RP+5) in June 2014. Therefore, this application is grandfathered under the 2006 Regional Plan policies. Open Space Design Development applications are generally reviewed in two stages: Stage I involves a site analysis identifying primary and secondary features to be avoided and potential development areas; Stage II is also known as the conceptual design process whereby the site layout, number of residential units, unit types, street network, open spaces and trails are reviewed. The Stage II application (Case 20110) included a request to extend the Municipal Water Service Boundary. The service extension component of the application proceeded through the planning process under a separate case number (Case 20264) and was approved by Regional Council in May 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
    This proposal was previously presented to North West Planning Advisory Committee on January 7, 2016 and November 1, 2017. Since then, the applicant has made additional revisions to the concept plan in response to public feedback and technical requirements to service the development. The major aspects of the most recent proposal are:
  </p>
  <p>
    • A Classic Open Space Design Development with a total of 368 residential units serviced by municipal water service and private on-site sewer systems
    <br/>
    • 197 single unit dwellings and 171 seniors housing units in the form of townhouses (45 units) and multiple unit dwellings (126 units)
    <br/>
    • 18.4 acres of parkland including an extension to the Monarch Rivendale Park, a new park at the end of Valerie Court and a trail connecting Duck Lake Brook Greenway and Monarch Rivendale Park
    <br/>
    • New public street connections off Wingate Drive, Elise Victoria Drive, Rivendale Drive, Briancrest Drive and Galloway Drive
    <br/>
    • Rezoning the lands from Mixed Industrial (I-1) and Mixed Resource (MR-1) to Mixed Use 1 (MU-2)
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to North West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community. The following is before the Committee:
  </p>
  <p>
    • Land use
    <br/>
    • Site layout

    <strong>
      7.1 STAFF
      <br/>
      7.1.1 Case 22865:
    </strong>
    WSP is applying on behalf of the property owner, to rezone a portion of 1633 Sackville Drive, Middle Sackville, from R-6 (Rural Residential Zone) to R-4 (Multiple Unit Dwelling Zone), to allow for a multiple unit dwelling with four (4) residential dwelling units.
  </p>
  <p>
    The major aspects of the proposal are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    • Designated Urban Residential under the Sackville Municipal Planning Strategy;
    <br/>
    • Currently zoned R-6 (Rural Residential) under the Sackville Land Use By-law;
    <br/>
    • The applicant wishes to re-zone a portion of the lot from R-6 to R-4 to enable a 4-unit building.
  </p>
  <p>
    Background
    <br/>
    • There is an existing single unit dwelling on the lands. This is proposed to stay on the site. A new lot will be subdivided from the property for the 4 unit dwelling. The Final Subdivision application has already been made by the land owner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proposal
    <br/>
    • The applicant is proposing to rezone a portion of 1633 Sackville Drive from the R-6 (Rural Residential) Zone to R-4 (Multiple Unit Dwelling) Zone of the Sackville Land Use By-Law.
    <br/>
    • The permitted uses in the R-4 Zone (subject to the zone requirements) are as follows:
    <br/>
     o Existing multiple unit dwellings in excess of six (6) units
    <br/>
     o Multiple unit dwellings containing no more than six (6) units
    <br/>
     o Open space uses
    <br/>
    • The applicant is proposing to rezone a portion of the site to allow for a four (4) unit multiple unit dwelling. Through a separate process, the applicant is pursuing a land subdivision to subdivide off a lot to leave the remaining single family dwelling on. So, as part of this application, the area where the existing single family dwelling is located is not requested to be rezoned.
    <br/>
    • The proposed building is designed as a 4-unit, 2-storey, townhouse-style multiple unit dwelling with separate exterior entrances for each unit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Policy UR-7 enables Council to Consider amendments to the Land Use By-law to permit multi-unit buildings up to six units. PAC feedback is sought relative to the application. In preparing a recommendation to the North West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community, specifically:
  </p>
  <p>
    • the adequacy of separation distances from low density residential developments;
    <br/>
    • that the height, bulk, lot coverage and appearance of any building is compatible with adjacent land uses.
  </p>
