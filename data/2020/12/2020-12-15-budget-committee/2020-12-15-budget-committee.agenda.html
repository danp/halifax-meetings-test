      Motion:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    That Budget Committee direct the Chief Administrative Officer to:
    <br/>
    1. Develop, “Strategic Initiative&#34; Reserves, as part of the 2021/22 budget process, for projects that are tied to an approved Council strategy and are significant enough to lead to a discernable increase in the tax rate or special funding that is outside the normal budget process. This should include any required
    <br/>
    changes to debt and reserve policies and should be eligible to be funded through dedicated tax levies.
    <br/>
    2. Starting with the 2021/22 budget and replacing the two-year detailed budget, develop a long-term Financial Plan, focused on sustainability, that includes a one-year Budget, a three-year outlook and a long-term plan based on Council’s Strategic Vision that supports the operating, capital and reserve
    <br/>
    budgets and allows the Municipality to meet its long-term goals.
    <br/>
    3. For the 2022/23 budget, provide a Tax and Fee Revenue Strategy to Budget Committee that will establish guiding principles for user fees and property taxes.
