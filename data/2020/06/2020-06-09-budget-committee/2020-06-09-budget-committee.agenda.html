      Motion:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    That the Budget Committee amend the Main Motion directing the Chief Administrative Officer to revise the 2020/21 Proposed Operating and Capital Budgets, as voted on by Regional Council’s Committee of the Whole on Budget at their February 12, 2020 meeting, using the revisions proposed in the staff report dated May 30, 2020 as summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3, supported by attachment C and D as previously amended through the Budget process.
  </p>
  <p>
    To further direct the Chief Administrative Officer to:
    <br/>
    1. Forgo the planned $12 million contribution to the Strategic Capital Reserve Q606 for fiscal 2020/21 and redirect this amount to the Capital Reserve Q526 to be used to cost share in Infrastructure Programs that maybe established by Federal and/or Provincial Governments in response to COVID-19.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Utilize $12.6 million in Fiscal Services to enhance municipal services that have been reduced due to COVID-19 and not currently budgeted for and/or to address adverse economic conditions as a result of COVID-19.
  </p>
  <p>
    And:
  </p>
  <p>
    That the Budget Committee recommend that Halifax Regional Council adopt the revised Resolution for Approval of Operating and Capital Budgets and Tax Rates for Fiscal 2020/21 as set out in Schedule 1 of the staff report dated May 30, 2020.
