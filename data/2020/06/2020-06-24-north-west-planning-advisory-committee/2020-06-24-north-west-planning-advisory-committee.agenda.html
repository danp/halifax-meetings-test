      7.1.1 Case 21355:
    </strong>
    Armco Capital Inc. is applying to enter into a development agreement to allow a residential development on lands between Lively Road and Wilson Lake Drive in Middle Sackville.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Proposal:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The applicant wishes to enter into a new development agreement to allow subdivision of the lands for residential development to allow a total of 167 residential units. The major aspects of the proposal are as follows:
    <br/>
    •    107 single unit dwelling lots;
    <br/>
    •    56 semi-detached dwelling units (28 lots);
    <br/>
    •    4 additional units if the detailed survey of wetlands and watercourses permits;
    <br/>
    •    Access from Wilson Lake Drive and Lively Road;
    <br/>
    •    Maintenance of a 30m tree buffer between existing lots along Lively Road and Wilson Lake Drive and the proposed lots; and
    <br/>
    •    1,789 square metres of parkland.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Development Plans outline the development proposal in detail, and include information related to the overall concept, traffic and servicing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Previous Application:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    A previous application was submitted in 2014 for a development agreement on these lands for a 270-unit residential development comprising of single unit dwellings, semi-detached dwellings, townhouses and multiple unit buildings (Municipal Case #19166). At the public meeting, on October 27, 2014, residents expressed concern with the higher density uses proposed (townhouses and apartment buildings), traffic and servicing. The community felt that the proposal was not compatible with the established residential community. This application was subsequently cancelled, and the applicant explored alternate development options for the property, giving consideration to concerns raised by staff and the community.

  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Proposal:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The applicant is proposing the development of a classic open space subdivision design.  As proposed, the subject site will allow for development of various forms of residential development, including: single unit, townhouse and multiple unit dwellings.  In accordance with municipal planning policy, 60 percent of the site will be retained as common open space.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Development Plans outline the development proposal in detail, and include information related to proposed building locations, new public streets and shared private driveways, common open space areas, location of proposed septic systems and traffic information.

    A public information meeting was held on Monday, August 28, 2017, at the Beaver Bank Kinsac Community Centre (Upstairs Lounge), 1583 Beaver Bank Road, Beaver Bank, NS, to discuss this application. Presentations from staff and the applicant show what was presented at the public meeting [links to these PowerPoint presentations can be found on the

    ].
  </p>
  <p>
    The application was presented to the North West Planning Advisory Committee (NWPAC) on January 6, 2016 and November 1, 2017 for a recommendation to North West Community Council. At both meetings, the NWPAC recommended that Council approve the application with consideration of additional matters listed in the minutes for both NWPAC meetings (provided below).
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the public meeting and recommendation from the North West Planning Advisory Committee, staff conducted another review of the application. The outcome of this review raised some technical challenges for the developer regarding the installation of water service laterals, which warranted reconsideration of the concept plan. The developer has submitted a revised concept plan in hope to address the technical challenges. The revised submission is currently under review by internal municipal staff from Planning, Development Engineering, Parks and Recreation, Fire Services, Subdivision and Development and Civic Addressing. External agencies also reviewing the application include Halifax Water, NS Environment and NS Power.
  </p>
  <p>
    Considerable time has passed since the last public information meeting and the concept plan has changed. Staff are currently seeking additional public feedback on the most recent submission. A notice has been sent to area residents requesting their feedback as staff continue to review the proposal. Please email any questions and comments you may have about the application. Residents will have another opportunity to provide feedback at a public hearing in the future, before Council makes a decision on this matter.

    <strong>
      7.1.3 Case 21996:
    </strong>
    HRM Corporate Real Estate is requesting to amend the Municipal Planning Strategy (MPS) and Land Use By-law (LUB) for Bedford to allow low-density residential uses (single-unit and two-unit dwellings) on a large portion of 18 Scotia Drive, Bedford. This proposal cannot be considered under existing MPS policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Background:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    18 Scotia Drive was home to the Sunnyside Elementary School (Waverley Road Site) from 1952 to 2012 before the school was closed by the Halifax Regional School Board. The subject site was conveyed to HRM in 2014. After obtaining the subject site, Regional Council declared the subject site as surplus, in accordance with Administrative Order 50, which guides the disposal of surplus real property.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subsequently in 2015, Regional Council asked that the property be re-assessed to determine if a portion of the subject site should be retained as open space. On February 16, 2016, Regional Council passed a motion declaring that:
    <br/>
    •    A southern portion of the lands be retained for a small pocket park;
    <br/>
    •    A portion of the lands, opposite of the Bedford By-pass, be retained for the Bedford    Educational Centre soccer field; and
    <br/>
    •    The Balance of the lands be declared surplus, in accordance with Regional Council’s previous  motion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The school was demolished in 2017.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <strong>
      Proposal:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    HRM Corporate Real Estate’s desire is to re-designate the subject site from the Institutional Designation to the Residential Designation and re-zone the subject site from the Institutional (SI) Zone to the Residential Two Dwelling Unit (RTU) Zone, so that a large portion of the site can be used for low-density residential dwellings. If approved, HRM Corporate Real Estate will attempt to sell the subject site to a private developer (at market value) who could subsequently extend Scotia Drive, subdivide lots, and develop one and/or two-unit dwellings.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Process:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The application is a request for new planning policy. Staff are reviewing the application, and will prepare a recommendation for Regional Council to consider. Before Regional Council can make any decision about the proposal, a public information meeting and a public hearing shall be held.
  </p>
