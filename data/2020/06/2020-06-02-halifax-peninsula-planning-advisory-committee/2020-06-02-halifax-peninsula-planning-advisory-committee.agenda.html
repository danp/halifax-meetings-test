      7.1.1 Case 22624:
    </strong>
    <a href="https://www.halifax.ca/media/69790">
      J. Thibault is applying for a development agreement to convert an existing commercial use to a residential unit.
    </a>
    [PDF]
  </p>
  <p>
    This Case was previously in front of HPPAC on March 9, 2020, however the request has changed (the applicant is now pursuing an additional residential unit through reconfiguration of existing floor space) and as PAC recommended on March 9, the application is in front of the PAC again, for comment. PAC recommended in favor of the application at the previous meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
    The major aspects of the proposal are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    •    Designated Medium Density Residential under the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy;
    <br/>
    •    Currently zoned R-2 under the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law, and the existing commercial unit is legal non-conforming;
    <br/>
    •    The applicant wishes to convert the commercial use to two residential units, creating a 6-unit residential building in total.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Background
    </strong>
    <br/>
    •    Existing 2-storey building with 4 residential units and one legal non-conforming commercial unit;
    <br/>
    •    Existing residential units are two 1-bedroom apartments, one 2-bedroom apartment, and one 6-bedroom apartment;
    <br/>
    •    Existing commercial use is a camera repair shop, and is 1152 square feet over two floors (ground floor and basement);
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Proposal
    </strong>
    <br/>
    •    The proposal is to convert the commercial space to a 3-bedroom residential apartment, and reconfiguring the existing six bedroom apartment into a 4-bedroom and a 1- bedroom. The conversion is within the existing building, and there is no change to building height or massing. The reconfiguration of the six bedroom apartment results in one less bedroom than before. Exterior changes are minimal and include the removal of the commercial entrance and refinishing it with the same residential siding on the rest of the building, and a new window. Please see the attached Planning Rationale for more detail.
    <br/>
    •    The site plan remains unchanged from the first time the application was in front of PAC. There are 6 existing parking spaces, the existing driveway is the propped access. Additionally, there is existing screening in the form of a 5 foot opaque fence along the entirety of the rear yard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementation Policy 3.14 enables agreements to permit a non-conforming use to be changed to another less intensive non-conforming use, or permit the structure in which such a use is located to be altered or expanded, provided the policy criteria are met. PAC feedback is sought relative to the application. In preparing a recommendation to the Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community, specifically:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    •    Layout and design of property is complimentary to the fabric of the neighborhood in terms of:
    <br/>
     o    primary and secondary entrances to the building;
    <br/>
     o    Architectural design; and
    <br/>
     o    Vehicular parking designed to not adversely affect the neighborhood causing nuisance.

    <br/>
    •    Two levels of underground parking
    <br/>
    •    Major rehabilitation of the Victoria Hall building
  </p>
