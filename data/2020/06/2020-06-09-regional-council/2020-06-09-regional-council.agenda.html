      Motion:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    That Halifax Regional Council request a staff report for a plan for the creation of a park at the Blue Mountain Birch Cove wilderness reserve. I request that this report include considerations for, projected land acquisition needs for the creation of the park, expected costs associated with land acquisition, projected costs of maintenance of the park before, during and after the acquisition of the necessary lands,
    <br/>
    staff requirements to maintain the park, boundaries of the park, timeline for the creation of the park, potential sources of funding for the creation and maintenance of the park, and mitigation of threats to park at this juncture. The staff report is required because of the changing nature our municipal budgets, and because of threats to the existing forests from fire, pests, and overuse.
