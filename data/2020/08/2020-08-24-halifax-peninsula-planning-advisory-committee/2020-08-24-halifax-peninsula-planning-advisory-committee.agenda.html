    <br/>
    • Approximately 30,500 square feet of underground commercial space;
    <br/>
    • An underground parking garage consisting of 511 parking spots;
    <br/>
    • Internal reconfiguration of 4 existing residential buildings (5969 and 5963 College Street and 1456 and 1452 Carlton Street) to accommodate 34 residential units;
    <br/>
    • Relocation of the buildings currently located at 5963 College Street and 5969 (registered heritage property) to the rear yards of 1452 and 1456 Carlton Street;
    <br/>
    • Consolidation of two existing properties along Carlton Street (1452 and 1456 Carlton Street); and

    In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is asked to review the proposed development with regard to the following:
    <br/>
    • Compatibility and impacts on adjacent properties (including existing heritage resources);
    <br/>

    <br/>
    • Traffic impacts;
    <br/>
    • Landscaping and buffering along the proposed east lot line or any property
    <br/>
    boundaries which abut a registered heritage property;
    <br/>
    • Proposed indoor and outdoor amenity space for on-site residents; and
    <br/>
    • The planning principles of transition, pedestrian-oriented, human-scale, building design and context sensitive, as identified in site-specific plan policy.
