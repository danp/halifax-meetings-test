    <a href="https://www.halifax.ca/media/69720">
      Case 21863: Application by Walid Jriege for a development agreement for property located at the corner of Sackville Drive and Wilson Lake Drive (PID 40574907), Middle Sackville to allow for a multiple-unit dwelling with a total of 7 dwelling units.

  </p>
  <p>
    A proposal for this site was first presented to the Committee on November 13, 2019. The Committee decided to defer a recommendation pending the receipt of more detailed information from the applicant.
  </p>
  <p>
    The applicant wishes to enter into a development agreement to allow for one building with a total of 7 residential units, in a townhouse-style arrangement of units. The major aspects of the proposal are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    •    The subject site is to retain existing R-6 zoning
    <br/>
    •    The current proposal is for 7 dwelling units in one building
    <br/>
    •    No subdivision of the lot will take place.
    <br/>
    •    Lot is 1.51 acres (6111 square metres)
    <br/>
    •    The applicant submitted servicing schematics for water and wastewater
    <br/>
    •    A Nova Scotia Power easement runs over small segments of the subject site
  </p>
  <p>
    The development agreement proposal is being considered under Policy UR-8 of the Sackville Municipal Planning Strategy. A conceptual site plan and building elevations have been prepared for the proposed 7-unit building. The proposed 7-unit dwelling is configured as a “townhouse-style” building. The site plan illustrates and labels the building footprint, driveway(s), parking spaces, landscaped areas, active/ amenity open spaces, buffers and tree retention areas. There are no apparent wetlands or watercourses, and the site will be sloped so that stormwater runoff goes to ditches on the boundaries of the property. There are no proposed accessory building(s), although the agreement could permit accessory building(s) and uses. The front elevation drawing now indicates proposed exterior building materials.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing a recommendation to the North West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to comment on and assess potential impacts of the proposal, specifically:
  </p>
  <p>
    •    the adequacy of separation distances from low density residential developments;
    <br/>
    •    that the height, bulk, lot coverage and appearance of any building is compatible with adjacent land uses;
    <br/>
    •    site design features, including landscaping, amenity areas, parking areas and driveways, are adequate size and design;
    <br/>
    •    proximity to community facilities such as schools, recreation areas and transit routes;
    <br/>
    •    that municipal central services are available and capable of supporting the development;
    <br/>
    •    that appropriate environmental and stormwater controls are in place;
    <br/>
    •    that the proposed development has direct access to a local street, minor collector or major collector;
    <br/>
    •    the impact on traffic circulation and, in particular, sighting distances and entrances and exits to the site;
    <br/>
    •    general maintenance of the development; and
    <br/>
    •    any other matter of planning concern.
  </p>
  <p>
    A public information meeting (PIM) was held May 16, 2019 at the Sackville Heights Community Centre - Silver/Gold Room - 45 Connolly Road, Middle Sackville, NS B4E 1S6.

    7.1.2
    <a href="https://www.halifax.ca/media/69721">
      Case 22704: Lydon Lynch Architects has requested a substantive amendment to an existing development agreement that enabled a multi-unit building, to allow for 9 additional units, on PID 41457979 located on Fourth St in Bedford.
    </a>
     [PDF]
  </p>
  <p>
    The applicant wishes to change the interior of the proposed building to increase the total number of units, which is resulting in changes to the window placement on the outside.  There will be no changes to the size of the proposed building—the size of the building will remain the same.  The major aspects of the proposal are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    •    Increase the total unit count from 18 to 27;
    <br/>
    •    Increase the number of surface parking spaces from 5 to 25, with corresponding changes to the site plan;
    <br/>
    •    Building size, shape, layout and location is the same as the approved DA; and
    <br/>
    •    Changes to the elevations to reflect a revised window placement.
    <br/>
    •    The Development Plans (provided below) outline the development proposal in detail, and include information related to the new site plan, elevations, addendum to the traffic statement and a planning rationale.
  </p>
  <p>
    The application will be considered under the substantive amendment to a development agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two public information meetings (PIMs) were held on February 19, 2020 at the BMO Centre - Multipurpose Room, 61 Gary Martin Drive, Bedford and Wednesday, March 11, 2020 beginning at 7:00 p.m. at Basinview Drive Community School (Cafeteria) - 273 Basinview Dr, Bedford, NS. At these meetings, presentations were given outlining the proposal with municipal staff and the applicant was in attendance to answer questions and receive feedback.
  </p>
  <p>
    The applicant has submitted plans and studies required by municipal staff to properly evaluate the application. The documents are also available for review at the Planning Applications office in Downtown Dartmouth.
