    Motion:
    <br/>
    That the Transportation Standing Committee request a staff report to review and establish criteria for new marked crosswalks that shall account for:
    <br/>
    •    not just existing crossings but also projected crossing demand;
    <br/>
    •    that takes into account land uses, present and future demand;
    <br/>
    •    pedestrian compliance, speed, safety, and crash history;
    <br/>
    •    recognizes that the practice of discouraging pedestrian crossings by leaving uncontrolled crossings unmarked is not a valid safety measure; and
    <br/>
    •    prioritizes proximity to schools, school walking routes, parks, trails, and other active transportation facilities as critical pedestrian destinations.”
