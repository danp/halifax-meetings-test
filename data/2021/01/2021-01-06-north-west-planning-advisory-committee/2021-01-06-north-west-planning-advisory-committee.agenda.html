      <strong>
        7.1.2 Case 22980: An application by West Bedford Holdings Limited
      </strong>
    </a>
    requesting changes to an existing development agreement for vacant lands off Amesbury Court with PID 41470741 in Bedford, to replace an apartment building already permitted by the existing development agreement with a townhouse development.
  </p>
  <p>
    The subject site is located within the Bedford West Comprehensive Development District Zone. This zone requires that North West Community Council approve a development agreement before any development can be permitted.
  </p>
  <p>
    North West Community Council approved a development agreement for the subject site and the surrounding area on June 23, 2011. This agreement has subsequently undergone two amendments that address development on two specific sites and that do not affect the subject site.
  </p>
  <p>
    The existing development agreement permits two apartment buildings on the site. The site is currently vacant.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br/>
    The applicant requests the following changes to the existing development agreement:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Change the development permitted on the subject site to allow:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            one six-storey multi-unit dwelling (apartment building) with 120 dwelling units (no change to what is already permitted); and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            21 townhouses;
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The existing agreement allows two apartment buildings; the total number of dwellings on the site would not increase if these changes are approved.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The subject site would be developed as “cluster development” and would not be subdivided. All the proposed buildings would be constructed on the same lot;
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Reduce the minimum width of townhouses from 6 metres (20 feet) to 4.9 metres (16 feet); and
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Remove the requirement that each townhouse have a garage and an individual driveway.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to North West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community. The following is before the Committee:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Potential for conflict with nearby land uses by reason of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            type of use;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            height, bulk and lot coverage of any proposed building;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            traffic generation, access to and egress from the site, and parking;
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Any other relevant matter of planning concern.
