    <br/>
    <strong>
      Motion:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    That Regional Council endorse the Canadian Urban Transit Association’s (CUTA) resolution:
  </p>
  <p>
    Whereas Halifax Regional Municipality has an interest in pursuing alternative propulsion technologies for Halifax Transit buses;
    <br/>
    Whereas a consensus is forming across Canada on the need to reduce GHG emissions through new technologies;
    <br/>
    Whereas emissions from the transportation are the second highest sector within Canada;
    <br/>
    Whereas Canadian transit manufacturers are currently researching, developing and deploying new electric transit technologies that will offer significant emissions reductions;
    <br/>
    Whereas costs for these new technologies are still out of reach for many Canadian municipalities, due in part to their slow rate of adoption across Canada;
    <br/>
    Whereas a leading factor in the slow adoption of electric transit technologies is the lack of technological harmonization across municipalities and between transit manufacturers.
