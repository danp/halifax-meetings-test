    <br/>
    <strong>
      Motion:
    </strong>
    <br/>
    That the Community Planning &amp; Economic Development Standing Committee request a staff report regarding options and financial implications to enhanced support for protection of heritage buildings in HRM, that shall include consultation with the Heritage Advisory Committee as appropriate, and include but not be limited to the following considerations:
    <br/>
    1. Tax relief - That registered heritage properties could receive an annual grant calculated as a percentage of property taxes paid;
    <br/>
    2.Tax lift - Upon approval of a major renovation and or restoration project any increase in property taxes that result from the resulting increased assessment would be rebated as a grant for a period of time, for example, 10 years;
    <br/>
    3. Grants - that the existing grants program would be expanded to allow for increased financial support for residential buildings, a separate program for commercial buildings, and inclusion of privately held institutional buildings in the grant program;
    <br/>
    4. 20th Century heritage - consider changing heritage registration criteria to better encourage registration of outstanding architectural examples from the war years (1918-1945) and create a mid-century category from 1945-1975;
    <br/>
    5. Holding bylaw - request the province allow municipalities to establish a heritage holding bylaw similar to other provinces, to allow short term protection of important unregistered historic buildings while Council considers possible registration.
