    The Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy allows for the consideration of residential buildings within lands shown on Schedule Q in the Halifax Peninsula Land use By-law by development agreement.  The policy directs Council to consider the relationship of new development to adjacent properties and uses, and the mitigation of these impacts.  The policy also directs Council to consider the creation of high quality design at street level, adequacy of open space and amenity areas and the integration into the existing street network.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Public Open House was held on October 4th.  Public feedback was collected through comment sheets.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council,  staff are requesting that the Committee advise whether the proposal complies with the policies of the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy in consideration of the following:
  </p>
  <p>
    - Does the building transition appropriately to the surrounding context?
    <br/>
    - Does the building provide an appropriate response at the street level on the Young St and Demone St frontages?
    <br/>
    - Are any treatments needed around the property edges?
    <br/>
    - Any other applicable land use issues/ impacts?
