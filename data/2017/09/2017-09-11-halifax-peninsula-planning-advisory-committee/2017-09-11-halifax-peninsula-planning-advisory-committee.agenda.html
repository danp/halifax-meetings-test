    The Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy designates the site (a HRM registered heritage property) for medium-density residential development. MPS policies provide for the development and change of use of heritage buildings, provided that the proposed use is compatible with the surrounding residential neighbourhood.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing your recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, kindly advise whether the proposal complies with the policies of the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy in consideration of the following:
  </p>
  <p>
    - Compatibility: Is the proposal to operate a pub/ lounge with restaurant compatible with the surrounding residential neighbourhood?
    <br/>
    - Are the proposed hours of operation suitable to address any compatibility issues?
    <br/>
    - Is an outdoor patio for patrons appropriate, given the surroundings, or should the pub/restaurant use be fully internal to the building?
    <br/>
    - Should residential unit(s) be included as part of the proposal, within the proposed vacant spaces?
    <br/>
    - Any other applicable land use issues/ impacts.
