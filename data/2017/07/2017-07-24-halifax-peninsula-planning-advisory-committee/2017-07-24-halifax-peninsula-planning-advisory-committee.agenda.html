    In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to consider whether the proposal complies with the policy in consideration of the following:
    <br/>
    - Density: Is the increase in residential density appropriate?
    <br/>
    - Building Design: Do the proposed changes to the already approved building offer high quality design, particularly at the street level? Does the proposed addition offer effective urban design in keeping with the context of Bloomfield Street and Almon Street, regarding building height and massing?
    <br/>
    - Parking: Is there sufficient parking? The proposal includes reducing the number of vehicle parking spaces from 82 spaces to 72. The number of bicycle parking spaces proposed meets the requirements of the Land Use By-law.
