    <strong>
      9.1 Case 21263
    </strong>
    – Application by Studioworks International Ltd requesting a substantive amendment to an existing development agreement on the lands at 6112 Quinpool Road, Halifax (The Keep).
  </p>
  <p>
    The applicant requests an amendment to the existing development agreement to permit canopies over the upper floor balconies as a functional enhancement to the building. The project is nearing substantial completion (anticipated for April, 2018) and this is a relatively minor architectural addition relevant to late stage construction, perhaps even after occupancy. Nevertheless, as canopies require engineer sign-off and modestly affect street-level perception of building design/massing, this change requires a DA amendment. Furthermore, the change is substantive as a wholly new architectural element does not qualify as solely a change in materials (cladding) as specified in the existing DA.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feedback is sought from Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committee relative to the proposed application. The committee’s recommendation will be forwarded along with the staff report to Halifax &amp; West Community Council.
