    10.1 STAFF
    <br/>
    10.1.1 Case 22314: Application by Wilson Wong, to rezone lands at 3850 Robie Street, Halifax from R-2 to R-2A to allow for a 6 unit residential building.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jason Wong has applied to rezone his property at 3850 Robie Street, Halifax from R-2 (General Residential Zone) to R-2A (General Residential Conversion Zone). Currently, there are 6 units in the dwelling and under the current Zoning only 4 units can be occupied. Rezoning from R-2 to R-2A will allow the legal occupation of the remaining two units.
  </p>
  <p>
    The major aspects of the proposal are as follows:
    <br/>
    • Designated Urban Settlement under the Regional Plan
    <br/>
    • Designated Residential under the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy
    <br/>
    • Zoned R-2 under the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law
    <br/>
    • Originally built as a 4 unit dwelling, it was converted to house 6 units
    <br/>
    • R-2 Zoning allows up to 4 units, leaving the 2 additional unoccupied
    <br/>
    • The R-2A zone would allow the legal re-activation of these two units
    <br/>
    • R-2A zone has strict standards regarding the conversion of existing housing
    <br/>
    • 50% of the units are required to be a minimum of 800 square feet in area
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community. The following is before the Committee:
    <br/>

    <br/>
    • Impacts on adjacent properties.
    <br/>
    • Preservation of neighbourhood context.
    <br/>
    • Ensuring varied housing options in neighbourhood.
