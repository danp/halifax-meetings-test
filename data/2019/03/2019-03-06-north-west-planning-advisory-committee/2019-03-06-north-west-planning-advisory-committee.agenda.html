    9.1.1 Case 21859: 665 – 685 Old Sackville Road and 750 Sackville Drive
    <br/>
    Case 21859: Studioworks Inc., on behalf of property owners Crombie Developments Limited and Beukema &amp; Nelson Independent Consultants Incorporated, is applying to rezone portions of lands at 665-685 Old Sackville Road and 750 Sackville Drive to DC-3 (Downsview Complex 3) to enable the construction of three new multi-unit dwellings.
  </p>
  <p>
    The major aspects of the proposal are:
    <br/>
    • Three new multi-unit dwellings on a vacant site;
    <br/>
    • Subject site abuts the Little Sackville River and incorporates a P-3 (Floodplain) Zone;
    <br/>
    - Boundary of P-3 Zone would not change if requested rezoning is approved;
    <br/>
    - No development permitted in the P-3 Zone;
    <br/>
    • Proposed development would provide a mix of surface and underground parking;
    <br/>
    • Access proposed to be from Old Sackville Road;
    <br/>
    • Final unit count, unit mix, site and building design, parking and landscaping would be determined at permitting and must comply with the Sackville Drive Land Use By-law; and
    <br/>
    • Proposed development would have to obtain Site Plan Approval from the Development Officer prior to permitting if the requested rezoning is approved.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to North West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community. The following is before the Committee:
    <br/>
    • Potential for conflict with nearby land uses by reason of:
    <br/>
    - type of use;
    <br/>
    - height, bulk and lot coverage of any proposed building;
    <br/>
    - traffic generation, access to and egress from the site, and parking;
    <br/>
    • Any other relevant matter of planning concern:
    <br/>
    - Sackville Rivers Floodplains Study (2017); and
    <br/>
    - Adequacy of mitigation of impacts on the Little Sackville River.
  </p>
  <p>
