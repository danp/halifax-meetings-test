    <br/>
    a. The proposed request to change the appearance of the ground floor of the Sackville Street frontage be amended so as to include additional glazing, preferably transparent but translucent at a minimum, to a minimum of 60% of the ground floor between Briar Lane and the main doorway to comply with the requirements for transparency and animation in the Design Manual; and
