    <br/>
    WHEREAS, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) adopted the Canada-wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) in 2009, and yet EPR programs are not in place in all provinces and existing programs lack harmonization and consistency;
    <br/>
    WHEREAS, EPR shifts the responsibility for managing PPP at end-of-life away from the taxpayer and empowers producers to drive innovation, product harmonization, and enhanced product recyclability;
    <br/>
    WHEREAS, while FCM has passed five resolutions on the subject of plastic pollution of which two refer to Producer Responsibility for plastics specifically, there is currently no official FCM policy relating directly to harmonization of EPR for Packaging and Paper Products (PPP);
    <br/>
    THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Federation of Canadian Municipalities further call on the Government of Canada to seek progress reports from provinces towards implementation of EPR and further create a harmonized regulatory framework for EPR across Canada including all packaging and paper products (PPP), in cooperation with all orders of government, industry and affected stakeholders, allowing for regional considerations and respect for Provincial authority.
