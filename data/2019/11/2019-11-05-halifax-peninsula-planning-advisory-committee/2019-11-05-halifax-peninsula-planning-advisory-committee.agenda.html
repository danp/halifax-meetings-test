      10.1.2 Case 22436:  Application by WSP Canada Inc., on behalf of the property owner, requesting non-substantive amendments to an existing development agreement on lands at 5885 Spring Garden Road, Halifax.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    WSP Canada Inc. has applied for non-substantive amendments to change the parking requirements and the building completion date in an existing development agreement for lands at 5885 Spring Garden Road. Halifax and West Community Council approved this 18-storey residential building addition with 104 units to an existing 11-storey building in April 2015 (Case 18270). The existing development agreement mandates a minimum of 230 underground parking spaces, with at least 6 of those spaces reserved for visitor parking and another 6 spaces for a dental office located in the 11-storey building. The completion date in the existing agreement is 5 years from the date of registration of the agreement, which was November 23, 2015.
    <br/>
    The major aspects of the application are as follows:
    <br/>
    •    Reduce the minimum number of parking spaces required from 230 to 180 spaces;
    <br/>
    •    Remove the minimum number of parking spaces for visitor parking in the multi-unit building;
    <br/>
    •    Change the size of the parking stalls from the requirements in the Halifax Peninsula LUB (2.7 metres wide &amp; 6.1 metres long) to the dimensions set out in the Centre Plan (2.4 metres wide &amp; 5.5 metres long); and
    <br/>
    •    Extend completion date by 5 years from original date of completion, to November 23, 2025.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following information has been provided to the Committee to consider in making their recommendation:

Attachment C contains a copy of a summary from the meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
    The public comments received include the following topics:
