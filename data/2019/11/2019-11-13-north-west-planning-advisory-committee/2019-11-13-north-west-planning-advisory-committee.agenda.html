    <br/>
    <strong>
      9.1.1 Case 22450: Application by Cresco Holdings Limited requesting a substantive amendment to an existing development agreement to allow for the transfer of up to 162 persons (equivalent to 72 multiple unit dwelling units) from their allowable commercial population to their allowable residential population.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The major aspects of the proposal are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    •    The subject site is designated Urban Settlement under the Regional Planning Strategy;
    <br/>
    •    The lands fall within two plan areas: Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and the Bedford Municipal Planning Strategy;
    <br/>
    •    The lands fall within Sub-area 9 of the Bedford West Secondary Planning Strategy (BWSPS);
    <br/>
    •    The lands are zoned BWCDD (Bedford West Comprehensive Development District) within the Halifax Mainland Land Use By-law and the Bedford Land Use By-law;
    <br/>
    •    The Development Agreement (approved in 2012, then amended in 2015 and again in 2017) permits a mixed-use development, including multi-unit dwellings, general commercial uses, and parkland and open space;
    <br/>
    •    The Development Agreement permits a maximum population of 1210.5 persons, and this is not proposed to change;
    <br/>
    •    The Development Agreement permits up to 200 multiple unit dwelling units on the lands, and the request is to amend this to allow up to 272 multiple unit dwelling units;
    <br/>
    •    The residential population is based on 2.25 persons per multiple unit dwelling unit and the general commercial population is based on 50 persons per acre.
  </p>
  <p>
    Policy BW-21D of the Halifax MPS and Policy BW-39C of the Bedford MPS enable the redistribution of population throughout the Sub Area, provided the intent of all the policies is maintained.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing a recommendation to both the Halifax and West Community Council and the North West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impacts on the community, specifically:
  </p>
  <p>
    •    Potential impacts on the surrounding community
    <br/>
    •    Any other applicable land use issues or impacts

    <strong>
      9.1.2 Case 21863: Application by Walid Jreige to enter into a development agreement on lands at the corner of Sackville Drive and Wilson Lake Drive, Middle Sackville (PID # 40574907) to allow for a multiple-unit dwelling containing 7 residential units.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The development agreement proposal is being considered under Policy UR-8 of the Sackville Municipal Planning Strategy. A conceptual site plan has been prepared. However, at this point, there is no detailed elevation plans and site plan for a 7-unit building.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing a recommendation to the North West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to comment on and assess potential impacts of the proposal, specifically:
  </p>
  <p>
    •    The adequacy of separation distances from low density residential developments;
    <br/>
    •    That the height, bulk, lot coverage and appearance of any building is compatible with adjacent land uses;
    <br/>
    •    Site design features, including landscaping, amenity areas, parking areas and driveways, are adequate size and design;
    <br/>
    •    Proximity to community facilities such as schools, recreation areas and transit routes;
    <br/>
    •    That municipal central services are available and capable of supporting the development;
    <br/>
    •    That appropriate environmental and stormwater controls are in place;
    <br/>
    •    That the proposed development has direct access to a local street, minor collector or major collector;
    <br/>
    •    The impact on traffic circulation and, in particular, sighting distances and entrances and exits to the site;
    <br/>
    •    General maintenance of the development; and
    <br/>
    •    Any other matter of planning concern.
