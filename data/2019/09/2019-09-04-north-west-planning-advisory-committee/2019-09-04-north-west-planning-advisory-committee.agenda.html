    9.1.1 Case 22334: Application by WM Fares requesting to enter into a development agreement to allow for a one storey commercial building at 1401 Sackville Drive, Middle Sackville
  </p>
  <p>
    The applicant is proposing a one-story, 7,000 square foot commercial building with 41 parking spaces in the rear of the property.
  </p>
  <p>
    The existing zoning does not permit stand alone commercial uses on the property, however, Policy UR-20 of the Sackville Municipal Planning Strategy does enable the request to enter into a Development Agreement to permit commercial service uses on the property.
