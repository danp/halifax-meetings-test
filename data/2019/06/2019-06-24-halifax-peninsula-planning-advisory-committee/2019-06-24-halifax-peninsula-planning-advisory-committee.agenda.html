      10.1.1 Case 22029
    </strong>
    : Application by APL Properties Limited to enter into a development agreement for a mixed-use building on the lands at 6009-6017 Quinpool Road, Halifax and to amend the Halifax Peninsula Land Use Bylaw to reflect Housing Nova Scotia’s process regarding possible affordable housing units
  </p>
  <p>
    In June 2018, Halifax Regional Council amended the Quinpool Road Commercial Area Plan of the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy and the Halifax Peninsula Land Use by-law to allow for a 25-storey mixed use building at 6009 – 6017 Quinpool Road.  Policies 2.10 to 2.10.4 of the Quinpool Road Commercial Area Plan were created to guide development of the site and allow development to occur by Development Agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, the applicant is requesting to amend the Halifax Peninsula Land Use Bylaw provisions regarding the bonus zoning option at the site to better align with Housing Nova Scotia’s existing processes and protocol.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess potential impact on the community with regard to the following:
    <br/>
    • Quality of indoor and outdoor amenity space;
    <br/>
    • Quality of design detail at street level including landscaping and building entrances;
    <br/>
    • Parking and traffic impacts; and
    <br/>
    • Wind and shadow effects.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following information is before the Committee:
    <br/>
    • Building Plans (with shadow study)
    <br/>
    • Wind Study

    • Traffic Study

    <strong>
      10.1.2 Case 22177
    </strong>
    : Application by W M Fares Architects requesting to enter into a development agreement to allow an eight storey mixed use building on lands at 6160 Almon Street and 2760 Gladstone Street, Halifax
  </p>
  <p>
    The applicant is proposing a residential and commercial mixed use building at the south corner of the intersection of Almon Street and Gladstone Street in Halifax at PIDs 00004945 and 00004952 or 6160 Almon Street and 2760 Gladstone Street, Halifax.
  </p>
  <p>
    The subject lands are designated Major Commercial under the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy (HMPS) and are within a Schedule “Q” area and zoned C-2 under the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law.
  </p>
  <p>
    Policy 2.3.1 of Section XI of the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy allows Community Council to identify areas designated Major Commercial for comprehensive site planning by applying Schedule “Q” which supersedes the requirements of the C-2 Zone and requires projects over four dwelling units to be considered by development agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enabling Policies 2.3.1 – 2.3.3 of the HMPS requires Council to consider the following:
    <br/>
    1) the relationship of new development to adjacent properties and uses; and, the mitigation of impacts on the amenity, convenience and development potential of adjacent properties through effective urban design and landscape treatment;
    <br/>
    2) the appropriate integration of the development into the traditional grid street system of the Peninsula;
    <br/>
    3) the design and layout of the development should encourage vehicular traffic to use Principal Streets and discourage traffic from infiltrating through existing neighbourhoods;
    <br/>
    4) the creation of high quality design detail at street level through attention to such matters as landscaping, signs, building entrances, and vehicle layby areas;
    <br/>
    5) the provision of high quality open space and leisure areas of a size and type adequate for the resident population;
    <br/>
    6) residential and commercial densities consistent with municipal services;
    <br/>
    7) encouraging high quality exterior construction materials such as masonry; and
    <br/>
    8) other relevant land use considerations which are based on the policy guidance of this Section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feedback from Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committee (HPPAC) is sought relative to the proposed application.  The Committee’s recommendation will be forwarded along with the staff report to Halifax and West Community Council.
