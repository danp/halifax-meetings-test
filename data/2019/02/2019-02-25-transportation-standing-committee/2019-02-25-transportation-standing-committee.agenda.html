    <br/>
    That the Transportation Standing Committee recommend that Regional Council direct the Chief Administrative Officer to:
    <br/>
    1. Amend the April 25, 2017 “Halifax Public Wi-Fi Solution Services Schedule” to the August 20, 2010 Master Services Agreement between HRM and Bell Aliant Regional Communications, and the Statement of Work executed with BellAliant on August 17, 2017, to

    <br/>
    b. provide for the design, installation and operation of, and document payment arrangements for, access points at the Alderney Ferry Terminal, the Halifax Ferry Terminal, and the Lacewood and Bridge Bus Terminals.
    <br/>
    2. In partnership with Halifax Public Libraries, begin a pilot program (lasting no longer than 12 months) to trial existing mobile library hotspots on up to 20 transit buses to gauge rider interest and understand support implications, subject to the successful negotiation and execution of relevant contract documents and purchase orders with HRM’s service provider(s).
    <br/>
    3. Based upon rider interest and findings from the preceding pilot program, consider development of a business case for expanding the service to additional terminals and/or additional buses/ferries and present the results to Regional Council.
