        10.1.1  Case 22005: Internal Conversions, Peninsula West Area 1 Schedule, Halifax Peninsula Land Use Bylaw
      </strong>
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Halifax and West Community Council requested that staff prepare a recommendation report on amending the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law to enable the internal conversion of existing residential buildings to a maximum of six units within the Peninsula West Area 1 Schedule.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Peninsula West Area 1 Schedule was created in 2003 when Community Council rezoned the lands to the R-1 (Single Family) Zone and created specific regulations regarding lot coverage, height, and lot alteration for properties within the Schedule.  The requested change, if approved, would only affect properties in the Peninsula West Area 1 Schedule.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing the recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, the Committee is being asked to assess the potential impact on the community.  Staff are requesting input on the following matters:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Internal conversion clauses in other area of the Peninsula LUB include provisions that must be met, such as minimum lot area, parking and open space, in order to be eligible for conversions - should similar conditions be included in this proposal?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following information is before the Committee:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Peninsula West Area 1 Schedule Map
    </li>
    <li>
      Staff Public Information Meeting Presentation

        10.1.2  Case 21979: Application by EDM Planning Services Ltd, requesting an amendment to the Height Precinct map of the Halifax Peninsula Land Use By-law for 2165 Gottingen Street, Halifax, to increase the maximum building height from 50 feet to 70 feet.
      </strong>
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    A building is currently under construction on this property. The proposal is to allow for one additional floor on the existing building under construction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feedback is sought from Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committee relative to the proposed application. The committee’s recommendation will be forwarded along with the staff report to Halifax and West Community Council.
  </p>
  <p>
    A postcard mailout to approximately 228 surrounding property owners and renters by HRM took place in late December of 2018 (in lieu of a public information meeting). To date, two email submissions were received from nearby residents or property owners regarding the following matters:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Seeking clarification on the proposal;
    </li>
    <li>
      Expressing concern with the additional building height increase; and
    </li>
    <li>
      Expressing concern that a public information meeting was not held.
    </li>

    The Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy designates the site for future major commercial and mixed-use development. The zoning of the site is C-2 (General Business) zone and a height precinct (limitation) of 50 feet applies to the site. The site lies within Area 8 of the Peninsula North Secondary Planning Strategy, which is the “commercial core” of Gottingen Street.  MPS policies provide for medium-rise development, and allow for proposals to amend the Land Use By-law, provided that such proposal is compatible with the surrounding neighbourhood.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparing your recommendation to Halifax and West Community Council, kindly advise whether the proposal complies with the policies of the Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy in consideration of the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Compatibility: Is the proposed increase in building height (one additional floor) compatible with the surrounding neighbourhood and consistent with the “medium-rise” intent of the MPS?
    </li>
    <li>
      Please advise of any other applicable land use issues/ impacts.
    </li>
  </ul>

        10.1.3  Case 21984: Application by EDM Planning Services Ltd, requesting to enter into a development agreement on lands at 2486 Creighton Street, Halifax to modify the R-2 (General Residential) Zone requirements and allow for a single unit dwelling with ground floor use for an office of a professional or a two unit (duplex) dwelling.
      </strong>

    The subject site is PID # 41463225. It shares an easement for driveway/ parking lot access with the adjacent building at Civic #2490. The lots were approved on May 18, 2018.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Halifax Municipal Planning Strategy designates the site for future medium density residential development. The zoning of the site is R-2 (General Residential) zone.
  </p>
  <p>
    The proposal involves the use of Implementation Policy 4.6 of the MPS (lot modification) to allow for a development agreement, which indicates that:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      “For any proposed development, the City may permit modification of the yard or lot area or width provisions of the Peninsula and Mainland Zoning By-laws…. provided that:
      <br/>
      (a) the amenity, convenience, character and value of neighbouring properties will not be adversely affected;
      <br/>
      (b) conditions necessitating such modification are unique to the lot and have not been created by either the owner of such lot or the applicant;
      <br/>
      (c) the modification is necessary to secure an appropriate development of the lot where such lot is of such restricted area that it cannot be appropriately developed without such modification;
      <br/>
      (d) the modification is consistent with Section II of this Plan; and
      <br/>
      (e) the registered owner of the land for which the modification is sought shall enter into an agreement with Council pursuant to Section 34(1) of the Planning Act.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Feedback is sought from Halifax Peninsula Planning Advisory Committee relative to the proposed application. The committee’s recommendation will be forwarded along with the staff report to Halifax and West Community Council.

    A postcard mailout to approximately 490 surrounding property owners and renters by HRM took place in early January of 2019 (in lieu of a public information meeting). Feedback was requested from residents/ property owners by Jan. 25th.
